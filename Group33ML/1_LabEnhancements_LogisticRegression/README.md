# Lab Enhancement 1: Logistic Regression for Diabetes Prediction

# Project Overview
This lab enhancement implements and analyzes Logistic Regression for diabetes prediction using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The project compares Logistic Regression with other classification models and includes comprehensive visualization techniques.

# Dataset
Pima Indians Diabetes dataset
Binary classification problem (diabetes/no diabetes)
Features include: pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age


# Key Components

## Data Analysis & Preprocessing
Feature standardization
Train-test split (80-20)
Missing value handling

## Model Implementation
Logistic Regression (75.32% accuracy)
Decision Tree (74.68% accuracy)
Random Forest (72.73% accuracy)

## Evaluation Metrics
Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve Analysis (AUC = 0.81)
Precision-Recall metrics
Classification reports

## Key Findings
Logistic Regression performed slightly better than tree-based methods
Model showed good balance between sensitivity and specificity
ROC-AUC score of 0.81 indicates strong predictive capability
